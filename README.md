Automatic/Live Detection of Potholes on Road Using ML.

Hardware Requirement :  Raspberry Pi , Pi camera or Usb camera , Buzzer. 
Software Requirement : Raspberry Pi OS, Python, Numpy, OpenCV, YoloV5, SMTP, NMS, GPIO.

Abstract : This project presents a real-time road anomaly detection system using Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, and a YOLO-based machine learning model. 
The camera captures live road footage, which is processed frame-by-frame to detect potholes and humps using image processing techniques. 
On detecting an obstacle, the system triggers alerts via email and optionally a buzzer. 
It is lightweight, scalable, and suitable for integration in smart transportation systems. 
The solution helps enhance road safety, reduce vehicle damage, and support timely maintenance planning.
